        <h3>Reddit Spoiler Avoider</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="subtitle">
        <p>Avoid spoilers in your home feed and in your favourite subreddits with this tool! </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subtitle">
        <p>Head over to the options page, type a subreddit name and click "Add Subreddit" to add it to your saved subreddits.
            Select the date and time from which posts should be filtered along with the filter category for each desired subreddit(s),
            set the desired subreddit(s) as active,
            then return to the popup and click "Refresh Filters" before opening up Reddit. Or, reload Reddit if you prefer.
        </p>
        <p>
            e.g. If you want to block all posts within the last hour, simply select today's date, choose the "after" filter category
            and set the filter date to one hour before the current date.
        </p>
        <p>NOTES:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This extension currently only works with the domains reddit.com and old.reddit.com.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unfortunately, Reddit is quite bloated (especially New Reddit), so the extension may take a couple of seconds to take effect if you choose to reload Reddit - avert your eyes if necessary!
